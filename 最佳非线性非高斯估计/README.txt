Introductions about the codes:

1.You can run 'Task1_Monte_Carlo.m' to gain the result of TASK 1, and the real state and observation value will be saved as 'x.mat' file and 'z.mat' file respectively


2.Ensure that 'x.mat' file and 'z.mat' file exist. You can run 'EFK_IEKF.m' to gain the result of TASK 2:Extended Kalman Filter and TASK 4: Iterated Extended Kalman Filter.


3.Ensure that 'x.mat' file and 'z.mat' file exist. You can run 'Task2_GBM.m' to gain the result of TASK 2:Grid Based Method.

4.Ensure that 'x.mat' file and 'z.mat' file exist. You can run 'PF_RPF.m' to gain the result of TASK 2:Particle Filter and TASK 4: Regularized Particle Filter.
